# Small ad hoc analyses

### Collection of my shareable small ad hoc analyses.


Purpose: To host, reuse, and share my code used in analyses, for myself and others interested in viewing or reusing.

Goal: Aim is to make the code parameterised and documented as much as possible time allowing, for ease of later use and understanding.

Notes: Each analysis will be in a separate folder and will include dependencies required.
For anything missed, please reach out!
